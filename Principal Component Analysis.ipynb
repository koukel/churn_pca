    "Organizations keep detailed records with many attributes to describe each customer.  Characteristics like the population where the customer lives and the number of children they have could factor into their decision to terminate services with the company.  The question I would like to answer with this report is: \"How can I optimize the customer data to best predict whether a customer will terminate their services?\"\n",

    "One goal of this analysis project is to create a list of components that contribute to at least 80% of the variability in the data. Ultimately, I would like to use this information to go back to some of the prior course tasks to see if using the transformations created using this PCA can create statistical models with higher accuracy."

    "In large datasets that contain many variables or \"features\", models can be affected by extra information that does not add value to the analysis technique (Wilson, n.d.).  This can happen in the case where the features are insignificant to the analysis or are highly correlated with other features.  One way to eliminate these issues is to drop those features from the dataset before creating a model, but this can result in the loss of data that might be helpful in prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method that uses feature extraction.  The algorithm performs a linear transformation on correlated variables and combines them into a new set of uncorrelated features (Loukas, 2020).  The feature combinations, or components, are ordered based on how much variability they contribute to the dataset.  The most useful components that provide the majority of the variability can be kept to create models for regression and classification, which will be free from the influence of multicollinearity (Brems, 2019).  The transformed components keep the majority of the information of the original dataset.  This can be seen in the case of image compression using PCA, where an almost exact replica of the original pictures can be seen after applying the inverse of the transformation (Boeye, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside of using PCA is that the transformed components are no longer the clear distinct variables of the original dataset.  Therefore, PCA should not be used when there is a desire to keep the independent variables available for interpretation (Brems, 2019).  "

    "One assumption of PCA is that the data has been standardized. While the variables being used in the PCA analysis are all numeric, many of them have large variations in the range of values. A variable like population can range into the thousands, while 'Yearly_equip_failure' has a maximum value of 6. Standardizing the data ensures that all features are using a similar range. This is important for PCA because it groups components to maximize the variance (Pedregosa, 2011). If the features are not scaled, PCA might incorrectly group the data causing it to underperform (Boeye, n.d.)."

This uses a scree plot on the PCA transformed data and looks for an \"elbow\" or bend where the data variability appears to level out.  In the case of my scree plot above, this occurs at component 6.  When I then performed PCA using six components, only 47% of the variance in the data could be described by the 6 components.\n",

Looking at the above scree plot, there is another elbow near there so I should have chosen a number closer to that for my initial PCA analysis."
